#### To use this environment with RCareWorld:

1. Make sure you have the scene files from the [dressing repo](https://github.com/empriselab/dressing_simulation). 
    1. Under the python-api branch in the Hospital Bed directory is a file called Test Robot with Bed.unity
2. The following files are different than their counterparts in the base RCareWorld repo: camera.py (add functions for point clouds), device.py (add wheelchair), robot.py (changes for wheelchair set joint velocities), controller_attr.py also for wheelchair joint velocities. The dressing environment is a new wrapper environment for the specific scene mentioned in point 1 and base rcareworld_env is also modified. 
3. The test scripts two_hole_load_cloud and two_hole_scene work with the scene in the dressing repo called Training 2 Hole in the simplified scenes branch. load_cloud.py can be disregarded as it was used to view some saved point clouds generated by test scripts (and those point clouds are not pushed). test_dressing should be the main interface to work with the scene and use the wheelchair, pointcloud, hospital bed features.
